QUESTION:
This is an interview question asked by Palantir.
Given a number represented by a list of digits, find the next greater permutation of a number, in terms of lexicographic ordering. If there is not greater permutation possible, return the permutation with the lowest value/ordering.
For example;
the list [1,2,3] should return [1,3,2]
the list [1,3,2] should return [2,1,3]
the list [3,2,1] should return [1,2,3]
NOTE: What is lexicographic permutation?
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are: 012 021 102 120 201 210.
