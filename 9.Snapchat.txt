his is an interview question asked by Snapchat.
Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.
The input list is not necessarily ordered in any way.
For example, given [(1, 3), (5, 8 ), (4, 10), (20, 25)], you should return [(1, 3), (4, 10), (20, 25)].
[[6, 8], [1, 9], [2, 4], [4, 7]]   -------> [1,9]
[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]  ------------> [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]] (edited)
